# A Simple Notespace

## What is this?
I am code illiterate, but I also want to learn to make webapps.. The solution? Setting up a seemingly simple project that can snowball into having waaay too many features as I keep trying to do more.

## Goals
- Website Title and Description above the Note
- Have nice colors
- Resizes for Mobile

Once satisfied with results I can Expand upon it,
- Add a dark mode
- Ability to change the font used
- Note saves after site reload via cookies
- Add an options button for pop-up menu
- Be able to share your note with other people. I don't know.
- **Add Markdown Support**

Expanding even further:
- Be able to fully customize the color palette (Background, Text, Markdown formatting, etc.)
- Add UX changes like animations when opening menus or hovering over icons - make it feel interactive and alive
- Make an accounts system to save your note and settings to a server
	- Add protections to prevent brute forcing passwords

Final:
- Be able to search for other people's notes.
	- Notes retain other people's color palettes and designs
